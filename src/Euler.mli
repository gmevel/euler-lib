  (** Arithmetic on overflowing integers.

      All operations defined here act on overflowing integers. An overflowing
      integer is any native integer (type [int]) except [Stdlib.min_int].
      Otherwise said, they are the integers whose absolute value is at most
      [max_int] = 2{^[int_size]−1} − 1. This makes the range of overflowing
      integers symmetrical, so that computing the opposite [( ~- )] or the
      absolute value [abs] never overflows (the presence of an additional value
      2{^[int_size]−1} being arbitrarily interpreted as a negative value fits
      the modulo semantics of integers, but is alien to an overflowing
      semantics). This allows to use [Stdlib.min_int] as a special value, for
      example to signal that an overflow occurred. Here, we rather raise an
      exception for that purpose. All functions in this library may fail when
      given [Stdlib.min_int] where an overflowing integer was expected.

      All operations defined here either are free of overflows, or raise
      [Overflow] when their {e result} would exceed the range of overflowing
      integers (and only in that case). Functions which can overflow are
      signaled explicitly in this documentation.

      Functions in this library may raise [Assert_failure], instead of the more
      traditional [Invalid_argument], when some precondition is not met. This is
      not necessarily signaled in this documentation, but all preconditions are
      stated in the English description of functions. However, we still treat
      division‐by‐zero differently than other preconditions; for that we raise
      [Division_by_zero], and signal it in this documentation.

      As much as possible, time and space complexities are indicated. If absent,
      constant time or constant space is implied.

  (** Modular arithmetic.

      This module defines modular arithmetic operations, that is, operations on
      elements of the ring ℤ∕{i m}ℤ where {i m} is a positive integer, called the
      modulus. All operations take {i m} as a named parameter [~modulo]. Elements of
      ℤ∕{i m}ℤ are represented by their canonical representatives between 0 and {i m}−1
      (included), of type [int]. All functions may assume that the modulus is
      positive and that canonical representatives are used, and may raise
      [Assert_failure] if that is not the case.

      The modulus can also be set globally, and not repeated for each individual
      operation, by giving it as a parameter to the functor {!Make}. This
      provides unary and binary operators.

      A related function, {!Primes.order},
      which computes the multiplicative order modulo {i m},
      is found in module [Primes],
      because it depends on computing integer factorizations.
